Installation
============

Grond is compatible with Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.4 and above.

.. _manual-install:

Manual installation (from source)
---------------------------------

First install Grond's prerequisites. It depends on

* `Pyrocko`_ - required
* `Kite`_ - optional, needed for InSAR data modelling

Next, get Grond's source code using :program:`git clone`:

.. code-block :: sh

    git clone https://github.com/pyrocko/grond.git
    cd grond

Finally, decide if you want to install Grond system-wide or just for a single
user.

System wide installation::

    sudo python3 setup.py install


Installation in your home directory::

    python3 setup.py install --user


Updating a manual installation
------------------------------

For updating an existing manual installation of Grond, update the source code
using :program:`git pull`:

.. code-block :: sh

    cd grond  # change to the directory to where you cloned Grond initially
    git pull origin master

Then just reinstall as described in section :ref:`manual-install` above.


Installation under Anaconda
---------------------------

Pyrocko's pre-built Anaconda packages are available online, Grond can be
installed with Anaconda's pip into the Anaconda environment.


.. code-block :: sh

    conda install -c pyrocko pyrocko
    pip install git+https://github.com/pyrocko/grond.git


Installation with pip
---------------------

If you want to install Pyrocko with pip, carefully read the section
`Installation with pip`_ in the Pyrocko manual first. We do not allow pip to
resolve its dependencies automatically, therefore you have to install
`Pyrocko`_ (required) and `Kite`_ (optional) separately.

.. code-block :: sh

    pip install git+https://github.com/pyrocko/grond.git
